 Binary classification using Logistic Regression on breast cancer dataset
This project implements a binary classification model using Logistic Regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It follows a complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and ROC analysis.

🔍 Key Features:
Uses Scikit-learn’s built-in breast cancer dataset

Performs feature standardization for better convergence

Evaluates using:

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC-AUC Curve

Visualizes model performance with ROC plot

Explains how logistic regression works using the sigmoid function

📌 Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

🎯 Outcome:
Achieves high accuracy and AUC, showcasing logistic regression’s strength in binary classification tasks with balanced datasets.
